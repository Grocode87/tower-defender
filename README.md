# My Personal Project
## Budgeting Tool

### Overview
This application will allow users to create a monthly **budget**. They can add 
multiple expense types and set a monthly limit for each of them. Then, the user
can input specific expenses, and view how much of their budget they have used
in the specific month per category and overall.


### Who is it for?
This project is meant to be used by anyone who needs a simple budgeting tool
that can help them manage expenses and make sure their monthly spending does not
get out of control.

A few examples of people who would benefit from this application:
- A university student
- A young person
- Someone trying to save for a big purchase

### Why does it interest me?
This project interests me because I am the exact person above, I really need a
budgeting tool so I can better track my many expenses at university.
