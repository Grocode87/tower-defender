# My Personal Project
## Tower Defense Game (TDGame)

### Overview
This application is a tower defense game. There is a path across the screen that
enemies make their way towards the end of. If the enemy makes it to the end, the
player loses, so they need to place towers along the path that shoot the enemies
before they make it to the end.


### Who is it for?
This project is meant to be a game that can be played by anyone for fun.

A few examples of people who would enjoy this game:
- A university student who is procrastinating an assignment
- Someone who enjoys playing tower defense games
- Me... hopefully

### Why does it interest me?
Game dev is how I got into programming, and it has always interested me, 
even though I stopped doing it as much. So I thought creating a game
would be a fun chance to try it again. I used to play a tower defense 
game when I was younger, and it would be really cool to recreate something
similar.
