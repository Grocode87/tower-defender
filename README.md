# My Personal Project
## Budgeting Tool

### Overview
This application is a tower defense game. There is a path across the screen that
enemies make their way towards the end of. If the enemy makes it to the end, the
player loses, so they need to place towers along the path that shoot the enemies
before they make it to the end.

This application will allow users to create a monthly **budget**. They can add 
multiple expense types and set a monthly limit for each of them. Then, the user
can input specific expenses, and view how much of their budget they have used
in the specific month per category and overall.


### Who is it for?
This project is meant to be a game that can be played by anyone for fun.

This project is meant to be used by anyone who needs a simple budgeting tool
that can help them manage expenses and make sure their monthly spending does not
get out of control.

A few examples of people who would benefit from this application:
- A university student
- A young person
- Someone trying to save for a big purchase

### Why does it interest me?
Game dev seems pretty fun and it would be very interesting to create a project
like this. I used to play a tower defense game when I was younger and it would
be really cool to recreate something like that
